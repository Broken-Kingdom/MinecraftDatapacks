A collection of all my Minecraft Datapacks that I make

## Installation
 To install any of my datapacks, navigate to the releases tab and find the datapack you'd like to download (some releases may be bundled together under a single post) or you can hit the green "Code" button and download the whole github as a .zip file! Either way, you'll be downloading a .zip file then you then need to extract the datapack you want out of it and into your world's datapack folder. i.e "C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\One Chunk\datapacks" 
 An easy way to access that folder (on Windows) is by pressing WIN + R then typing %appdata% in the box that appears. 

## Essentials Plugin (Vanilla)
 This is just a weird, fun datapack I made for myself and friends and is nowhere near completion, nor do I expect to pick up developing it as it currently is. I DO plan on
 potentially revisiting it and actually creating a proper datapack with a similar idea.

## One Chunk Challenge - 1.0.1
 This is the 1.0 full release of a datapack I made after watching CallMeKevin's playthrough of Minecraft doing "One Chunk Only" and his change to "Two Chunk Only". 

## sselesU Death Pack - 1.0.0
 This is a 1.0 release of a datapack I made for myself and friends to do "hardcore" minecraft (only one life) except that it's actually configurable to have a certain maximum death count and then it sets you to spectator. The idea is that you have X deaths before you're out of the world and then we would reset the deaths per week or month... you get the point. You can play it however you wish though. You could keep it to the standard "1 life" and then delete the world start again if you wanted.
 
## sselesU Pack - Definitely NOT ready for release
 This is a pretty old datapack I worked on and isn't balanced at all but it's made for a skyblock server in order to have cool features using vanilla. The thing about it is I wasn't doing that server completely vanilla because I had a plugin to manage all the islands. It was just a passion project that I do plan on returning to some time!
