# MinecraftDatapacks
 A collection of all my Minecraft Datapacks that I make

## Essentials Plugin (Vanilla)
 This is just a weird, fun datapack I made for myself and friends and is nowhere near completion, nor do I expect to pick up developing it as it currently is. I DO plan on
 potentially revisiting it and actually creating a proper datapack with a similar idea.

## One Chunk Challenge - 1.0.0
 This is the 1.0 full release of a datapack I made after watching CallMeKevin's playthrough of Minecraft doing "One Chunk Only" and his change to "Two Chunk Only". I've actually made this for him and I'm hoping he likes it and uses it in his video. 

## sselesU Death Pack - 1.0.0
 This is a 1.0 release of a datapack I made for myself and friends to do "hardcore" minecraft (only one life) except that it's actually configurable to have a certain maximum death count and then it sets you to spectator. The idea is that you have X deaths before you're out of the world and then we would reset the deaths per week or month... you get the point. You can play it however you wish though. You could keep it to the standard "1 life" and then delete the world start again if you wanted.

## sselesU Pack - Definitely NOT ready for release
 This is a pretty old datapack I worked on and isn't balanced at all but it's made for a skyblock server in order to have cool features using vanilla. The thing about it is I wasn't doing that server completely vanilla because I had a plugin to manage all the islands. It was just a passion project that I do plan on returning to some time!
